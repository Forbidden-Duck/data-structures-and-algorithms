# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is currently under-development.

## What will it include?

**1. Models of SingleNode and DoubleNode**

-   SingleNode is designed to only store the data you include and the next SingleNode instance
-   DoubleNode is similarly designed however it includes the previous DoubleNode instance

**2. SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList**

-   SinglyLinkedList uses SingleNode to create a linked list
-   DoublyLinkedList uses DoubleNode to create a linked list

**3. Queues**

**4. Stacks**

**5. Hash Maps**

**6. Binary Tree**

**7. Heaps**

**8. Graphs**

**9. Algorithms**

-   Recursion
-   Asymptotic Notation
-   Bubble Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Quicksort

**10. Search and Graph Search Algorithms**

-   Binary Search and Search Trees
-   Graph Traversals
