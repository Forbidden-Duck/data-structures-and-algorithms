# Data Structures and Algorithms
This project is currently under-development.

## What will it include?

**1. Models of SingleNode and DoubleNode**
- SingleNode is designed to only store the data you include and the next SingleNode instance
- DoubleNode is similarly designed however it includes the previous DoubleNode instance

**2. SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList**
- SinglyLinkedList uses SingleNode to create a linked list
- DoublyLinkedList uses DoubleNode to create a linked list

**3. Binary Tree**

**4. Queues**

**5. Stacks**

**6. Sorting Algorithms**
